# Clinic Search UI
![app screenshot](public/app_screenshot.png)

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app). It provides a basic frontend UI that allows users to search patient data as if they were an admin at the health clinic. It uses the logical model created in Hasura to give an example of search functionality being used within a client app.

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm install`

Installs the dependencies needed to run this frontend react app.

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode. \
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.
